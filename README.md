**Contactor Didactic Panel GUI and Oscilloscope Integration**\nThis project provides a "real-time visualization tool" for students learning about "delta and star formations in three-phase motors." It features a "user-friendly GUI" that mirrors the connected oscilloscope, allowing "seamless waveform analysis." With "custom APIs for oscilloscope communication," it bridges hardware and software for an educational hands-on experience.
